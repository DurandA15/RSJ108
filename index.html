Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Find a Good View</h3>
              <p>
                Walk around and find a sight you like or one you think could be a cool photo. Then take out your phone. Congratulations, you’re done with the first step!
              </p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Use the Rule of Thirds</h3>
              <p>
                The Rule of Thirds uses a grid laid over a photo in order to take the most aesthetically pleasing photo to the eye. To turn on the grid in the camera app of the Iphone, go to settings, camera, and under composition, turn on the grid. VSCO itself also allows you to take photos. Just open the app, click the camera icon in the top right corner and then tap the third option from the right up top to make the grid appear. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you have the grid up, line up a part of the scene you’re taking an image of with the grid. You can line things up where the grid intersects or along the grid lines itself. It is really up to you, but using the rule of thirds will automatically make your photos better. 
              </p>

              <h3>Open VSCO and Set Up a Free Account</h3>
              <p>
                If you haven’t done so already, open the VSCO app and create an account. The app asks for simple information and will only take a few minutes to set up your account. VSCO has both a free and paid version, though for the purposes of this tutorial, you will only need the free version. If you wish to gain access to the extra features and filters, you can pay for the membership, but again this is not required. All that is shown within this tutorial is from the free version of VSCO. 
              </p>
          </li>

          <!-- Step 4 -->

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Editing Your Photo</h3>
              <p>
                Editing your photo in VSCO is straightforward. As mentioned before, with the free version of VSCO, there are several features that are not available. When editing your photo, you may see that some edits and filters have a lock on them. This means that that edit or filter is restricted only to those who pay for a VSCO membership. Despite this, VSCO provides a decent library of filters and editing options for free members, making it a worthwhile tool even to it’s non-paying members.
              </p>
              <p>
              To begin editing your photo in VSCO, open the app. It should automatically take you to the studio within the app. If not, you can simply press the + icon at the bottom of the screen to take you there. If you have allowed VSCO access to your camera roll, you should see all of your photos ready for you to edit. If not, go into your settings and give VSCO access to your camera roll.
              </p>
              <p>
              To edit your photo, click on it and then select the edit option that should appear at the bottom of your screen. From here, you will have a variety of options as to how to edit your photo. The first option you will see will be the filter options. You can view the filters in a variety of ways by simply tapping the leftmost icon at the bottom of your screen. Once selecting a filter by tapping on it, you will be able to adjust the strength of the filter via a slider. To cancel any changes, tap the x, and to save any press the checkmark. 
The second icon at the bottom of your screen will take you to all the other editing options available to you. With the free version of VSCO, you’ll be able to change the cropping and size of the photo, the exposure, contrast, sharpen, clarity, saturation, tone, white balance, skin tone, vignette, grain, fade, and split tone of the photo.
              </p>
              <p>
              The 3rd option at the bottom of your screen will allow you to put special effects on the photo. This option though is only available to those who pay for a VSCO membership.
              </p>
              <p>
              The fourth option at the bottom of your screen will give you the option to undo or adjust any filters or edits you have added to the photo.
              </p>
              <p>
              Finally, the last option at the bottom of the screen will allow you to save edits and even arrange your workspace to better suit your needs.
              </p>
              <p>
              Below is a video by Tech ZG Guides. The first 5 ½ minutes focus on various features of the app itself, but skip to 5:34 for a good tutorial on how to take photos in VSCO and 7:08 for a tutorial on importing and editing photos in VSCO.

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Exporting Your Photo</h3>
              <p>
                Select the next button at the top right of the screen. You will be presented the options to save to your camera roll and post to VSCO itself. Choose which option you want and press save. 
</p> 
            </div>
          </li>
          <!-- Step 6--> 
  <li>
  <div class="content">
    <h3>Share Your Photo with Others</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have your photo saved to your camera roll, open up twitter, or any other social media platform, and post away. Add some commentary text to provide context and you’re set. Posting is a key step to editing photos because if you don’t ever share your work, no one will ever know it exists. And boom, you're done! You’ve edited your first photo using VSCO! Now go take some more photos and get creative.
